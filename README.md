# Podcast App
 Podcast Apps with MVC, MVVM, VIPER Arch

## Description
* In this application, I examined the MVVM, MVC and VIPER architectures, the relationships, communication and data flow they create.
* I experimented and observed the differences between these architectures.
* Also, I wrote separate Unit tests for each architecture.
