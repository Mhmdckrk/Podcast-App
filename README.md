# Podcast App
 Podcast Apps with MVC, MVVM, VIPER Architecture Pattern.

## Description
* I use iTunes API.
* In this application, I examined the MVVM, MVC and VIPER architectures, the relationships, communication and data flow they create.
* I experimented and observed the differences between these architectures.
* Also, I wrote separate Unit tests for each architecture.
* UIKit and Storyboard (No Programmatic UI)
